<h3>Traveling Adventures</h3>
<p>
	One of my favorite places that I've travled to is Iceland. I've been to Iceland twice, once in 2016 and 2018. I traveled the whole ring road where I hiked up glaciers and mountains. One of the highlights was hiking up mountain Kirkjufell, which is famous for being on Game of Thrones.

	Another highlight is seeing my two friends get married underneath a waterfall. Prior to the wedding, it was raining heavily in Iceland. Luckily, just 2 hours before the wedding, the rain stopped and the skies started to clear. After a short hike in a dress and heels, we made it to the waterfall and were amazed by the views. We were able to get a few magical shots before the wedding started. </div></p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>Below you will see two maps. One map is from my 2016 trip where we traveled the ring road. The second map mostly consists of the wedding itinerary. </p></div>
